python_selflearning_examples1.py 

1: Print the cube of the ints inside a list
  
2: Prints a pattern of stars depending on users input

3: Use the break function

4: Type the word Gilly  

5: Print the average of positive integer numbers, enter a negative integer to stop  

6: Reverse sort order print the strings in a list 

7: Sort the dictionary  

8: Output only the even aged animals  

9: Weekday or Vacation  

10: Check how many even ints are in a list. For every even int square it and add it to the sum  

11: Check if the first or the last element in a list is 7  

12: Return the string with every chracter outputted twice in the same order  

13: Use various functions to perform string manipulation with the input of the user
 
14: Using context manager - with  

15: Aquiring index and element from list using for loop  

16: Looping over 3 lists and combine output - using zip  

17: Unpacking  

18: Understanding try, except, else and finally  




python_selflearning_examples2.py 

1:Sum the numbers from 0 to n-1 in different ways - complexity  

2: Multiple input arguments and parameters in funcs *args 2*args  

3: Scope: Global vs Local Variables   

4: Function that takes int and has 4 different output cases

5: Concatinate 2 tuples

6: Initialize a 5 by 5 numpy array with only zeros.

7: Read a .csv file using Pandas.

8: Create a Pandas Series from data.

9: Reverse a string.

10: Create a new column in pandas by using values from other column.

11: Select columns in pandas and add them to a new dataframe.

12: Select columns in pandas and add them to a new dataframe.

13: Warmup-1 > monkey_trouble. Return True if both smile or neither is smiling

14: Given two int values, return their sum. Unless the two values are the same, then return double their sum

15: Given an int n, return the absolute difference between n and 21, except return double the absolute difference if n is over 21

16: We have a loud talking parrot. The "hour" parameter is the current hour time in the range 0..23. 
We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. Return True if we are in trouble

Task 17: Given a string, return a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged
  
18: Given a string, return a new string where "not " has been added to the front. 
However, if the string already begins with "not", return the string unchanged

19: Given a non-empty string and an int n, return a new string where the char at index n has been removed. 
The value of n will be a valid index of a char in the original string (i.e. n will be in the range 0..len(str)-1 inclusive)

20: Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. 
If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front

21: Given 2 strings, a and b, return the number of the positions where they contain the same length 2 substring. 
So "xxcaazz" and "xxbaaz" yields 3, since the "xx", "aa", and "az" substrings appear in the same place in both strings

22: Given an array of ints, return True if the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 appears in the array somewhere

23: Given an array of ints, return True if one of the first 4 elements in the array is a 9. 
The array length may be less than 4


python_selflearning_examples3.py 

1: Iterate with enumerate instead of range + len

2: Use list comprehension instead  of raw for loops

3: Sort complex iterables with the sorted method

4: Store unique values with sets

5: Save memory with generators 

6: Define default values in dictionaries with .get and .setdefault

7: Count hashable objects with collections.Counter

8: Format strings with f-strings

9: Concatenate strings with .join

10: Merge dictionaries with a **

11: Simplify if statements with if x in list 

12: counts longest ascending order numbers in a string
